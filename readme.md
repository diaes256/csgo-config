# autoexec.cfg
This is my personal autoexec for csgo, I hope it can be useful for anyone
that is trying to become a professional csgo player.

Install the `autoexec.cfg` in this path:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<your-user-id>\730\local\cfg
```

In this path will be a file called `config.cfg`, add there in the last line this:

```
exec "autoexec.cfg"
```
